                <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>Working at the Department of Employment & Labour in Pretoria under the IT & ICT Division to understand how information technology is used in the public sector, especially how the government utilises IT and ICT. During my time there I learnt about the different hierarchies there are with the government and how you can scale up with a background in IT. My time job shadowing was very informative and eye ­opening.</p>
